# GDS Components

These components are React implementations of the HTML snippets of the [GDS components](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/) intended for use by this component library. When writing these components, the emphasis is on simplicity for our use cases, meaning they might not contain all the features seen on the GDS site if they aren't needed for our usage.
