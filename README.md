# Timetable Visualisation

The `master` branch is used to distribute the visualisation component via the [Statically](https://statically.io/) CDN. Commits to the `main` branch will create new builds of the JavaScript and CSS files which can be accessed via the Statically CDN URLs:

```
https://cdn.statically.io/gh/digital-land/local-plans-timetable/master/timetable-visualisation.min.js
https://cdn.statically.io/gh/digital-land/local-plans-timetable/master/timetable-visualisation.min.css
```

We also distribute the GDS font files from `assets/fonts` to ensure they're accessible from the CDN CSS file.
